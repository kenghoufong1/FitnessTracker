## Overview

### Description
In project #2 we were given the opportunity to showcase what we've learned over the past six modules to create a real-world full-stack application. To demonstrate our skills and ability to work as a team, we created a Wellness Tracker. This application will track users' worksouts, duration of workouts, weight, mood. In addition, it will display a graph to track users' progress. 

### Usage

### What we Learned
- We learned paying attention to details is crucial when building, as we had some inconsistencies in our naming or how we organized our files that created bugs. Staying focused on the key requirements helped us focus on the right things and help manage our time to finish on time. Clear communication to align quickly to build the framework of our app was key to making quick decisions. When learning a new technology and implementing, we learned that it's best to build in small pieces, test frequently, and build upon those pieces to help debug issues easier and faster.
